This is an auto-response bot I wrote for the Chinese mobile messaging app WeChat (微信).

This command-line program interactively supports the following modes: 

  1. automated chatting
  
  2. Google translate (between Chinese and English)
  
  3. funny Cantonese posts from HKGolden, a popular Internet forum in Hong Kong
  
  4. reverse
  
  5. weather forecast (English preferred but okay to use any other language)
  
  6. stocks and candlestick plots; supports searches by tick symbol or company name in any language; for candlestick plots, the user (the other user in the chat) can choose any number of days shorter than 10 years
  
  7. tweets
  
  8. Merriam-Webster dictionary
  
  9. Ytenx dictionary, an online dictionary that incorporates several ancient "rime dictionaries" on ancient classical Chinese phonology
  
  10. Wikipedia
  
  11. Shutup
  
and the program can also capture messages the other user in the chat recalls. Everything printed out is in Chinese.

One can control the bots by sending a message beginning with the dollar sign $, but all instructions and feedbacks are in Japanese only.
